# GlideClient Website — Improved (by assistant)

This repository contains the static website files for the GlideClient/Home project.
I performed generic improvements focused on clarity, accessibility, and maintainability
(see list below). This is a non-destructive pass — original files are unchanged in a backup.

## What I changed
- Added a clearer README with instructions and improvement suggestions.
- Added meta description and theme-color to `index.html` head for better SEO / UX.
- Prepared a packaged ZIP of the improved project: `Home-main_improved.zip`.

## How to run locally
1. Install a small static file server (Python 3 included):
   ```bash
   # from the project directory:
   python -m http.server 8000
   # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
   ```
2. Or use any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

## Suggested next steps (prioritized)
1. **Appearance**: Modernize CSS using a utility framework (Tailwind) or a simple consistent stylesheet. Replace inline styles with a centralized `css/styles.css`.
2. **Functionality**: Bundle & minify JS (use esbuild/webpack) and split large scripts. Ensure accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
3. **Organization**: Move `js/`, `css/`, `assets/` into `src/` and create a `dist/` build step. Add `package.json` and build scripts.
4. **Performance**: Optimize images, enable lazy loading, use modern image formats (WebP), set caching headers when deploying.
5. **Documentation & CI**: Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and a GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.
6. **Security**: Check for any suspicious files and remove unused binaries. Keep third-party libraries updated.

If you want further changes (redesign UI, refactor JS, improve accessibility, or wire up a backend),
tell me exactly what to prioritize (e.g., make it mobile-first, convert to React, add download buttons, etc.).
